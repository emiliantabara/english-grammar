## De retinut

1. Reguli pentru adaugarea terminatiei „-s" sau „-es" la afirmativ pentru persoana a III-a singular
2. La majoritatea verbelor se adauga terminatia „-ing" fara nici o modificare:
	
		play – playing
		try – trying
		drink – drinking
		sing - singing

3. La verbele care se termina in litera e precedata de o consoana, se renunta la litera e si se adauga terminatia "-ing"

Exemple:

	make – making
	come – coming
	leave – leaving

La verbele formate dintr-o singura silaba (monosilabice) care se termina intr-o consoana precedata de o vocala, se dubleaza consoana si apoi se adauga terminatia "-ing"

Exemple:

	get – getting
	sit – sitting
	hit – hitting
